#Countdown Letters Game Solver
####Requirements :
You are required to create two pieces: a Python script that solves the Countdown letters game, and a document explaining how your solver works. The Countdown letters game is as detailed on Wikipedia. Esentially, you are given a list of nine random letters which contains at least three vowels and four consonants. You must find the longest possible word in the Oxford English dictionary that is an anagram of some or all of the letters in the random list. If there is more than one word of longest length, then each is as acceptable a solution as the others.

### Word list :
I have a few lists of words.
On this git account i found a good word Dictionary.

###Python scrips :
I have 2 python script, the python.py script contains some of the other ways i tried to do this project. Left the most efficient uncommented.
The other python script contains my final attempt at the project. 

###Efficiency :
I used the ittertools import this makes the project more efficient overall, It saves more memory.

####Results:
My script is not the fastest but it is efficient and meets the requirements.
Runs the game in over one second.
Shows the randomly suffled word,
Shows the longest word that it found in the dictionary created from that shuffled word.
