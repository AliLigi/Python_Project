#Countdown Letters Game Solver
####Requirements :
You are required to create two pieces: a Python script that solves the Countdown letters game, and a document explaining how your solver works. The Countdown letters game is as detailed on Wikipedia. Esentially, you are given a list of nine random letters which contains at least three vowels and four consonants. You must find the longest possible word in the Oxford English dictionary that is an anagram of some or all of the letters in the random list. If there is more than one word of longest length, then each is as acceptable a solution as the others.

### Word list :
I have a few lists of words.
On this git account i found a good word Dictionary.
